<p>The <code>Locale.getDefault()</code> method will often return a value that doesn’t match the user-preferred locale. There should only be a small number of instances that this method is actually acceptable for use as a default -- perhaps once in the entire code base, if that. All other uses will always indicate a risk. This method is prone to more problems due to JVM initialization of locale (along with charset/encoding).</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
  Locale.getDefault()
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
  Locale userPreferredLocale = Locale.forLanguageTag("zh-Hans");
  ...
  text.toLowerCase(userPreferredLocale);
</pre>
